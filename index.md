## About
I am an economist by training and now research how **positive economic developments** can reduce support for **populist parties**. My work connects political behavior with regional and local economic change, using quasi-experimental and applied micro approaches.

## Research (current projects)
**1) Milieuschutzgebiete in Berlin and voting behavior**  
I study whether the designation of *Milieuschutzgebiete* (social preservation areas) affects electoral outcomes—focusing on potential mechanisms such as housing stability, neighborhood change, and local political mobilization.

**2) Treuhand-related job losses and hate crime**  
This project examines whether job losses linked to Treuhand privatization are associated with subsequent variation in hate crimes, exploring economic insecurity and grievance as potential channels.

## Updates
- *Add short notes here over time (new data, conferences, preprints, etc.).*
