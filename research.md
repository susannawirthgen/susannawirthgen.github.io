## Research agenda
My research asks how **economic conditions and economic change** shape political behavior—especially voting for populist parties—and related outcomes such as political violence and hate crime.

## Projects

### Milieuschutzgebiete in Berlin and voting
- **Question:** Do *Milieuschutzgebiete* affect voting patterns (e.g., turnout or support for populist parties)?
- **Approach:** Neighborhood-level analysis with policy timing and spatial variation; mechanisms related to housing markets and neighborhood change.
- **Status:** Ongoing.

### Treuhand-related job losses and hate crime
- **Question:** Are Treuhand-linked job losses associated with later hate crime incidence?
- **Approach:** Regional variation in exposure to privatization-driven employment shocks; linking economic and crime/political outcomes.
- **Status:** Ongoing.
